# Week 3 Python Assignment

## Overview
Welcome to the **Medical Python Assignment**! This project is designed to enhance your understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python while applying them to real-world medical scenarios. Each problem in this assignment represents a different aspect of a hospital or healthcare system, ranging from patient management to medical records and treatment plans.

## Objective
The main goal of this assignment is to reinforce your knowledge of **Classes and Objects** in Python by building structured and reusable code. By solving these tasks, you will:

- Develop a deeper understanding of OOP principles.
- Work on real-world healthcare-related challenges.
- Improve problem-solving and teamwork skills.

## Teamwork & Collective Intelligence
This assignment is meant to be completed in **teams**. The purpose of working in groups is to promote **collective intelligence**, a core principle of **SPARK**. By collaborating, sharing ideas, and discussing different approaches, you will enhance both your coding skills and your ability to work in a professional setting.

### Why Teamwork Matters
- Encourages **knowledge sharing** and **peer learning**.
- Mirrors real-world collaboration in software development.
- Promotes efficient problem-solving through different perspectives.
- Strengthens communication and leadership skills.

## Assignment Structure
Each team is required to complete the following **Python OOP exercises**, which are all based on medical scenarios:

## 1. Patient Management (`patient.py`)
   - Stores patient details and medical history.

## 2. Doctor Management (`doctor.py`)
   - Tracks doctors and their assigned patients.

## 3. Hospital Bed Management (`hospital_bed.py`)
   - Assigns and releases hospital beds for patients.

## 4. Blood Bank System (`blood_bank.py`)
   - Manages blood donations and requests.

## 5. Prescription Tracker (`prescription.py`)
   - Stores and manages patient prescriptions.

## 6. MRI Scan Reports (`mri_scan.py`)
   - Stores findings from MRI scan reports.

## 7. COVID-19 Test Results (`covid_test.py`)
   - Stores and updates COVID-19 test results.

## 8. Vital Signs Monitor (`vital_signs.py`)
   - Tracks and checks critical patient vitals.

## 9. Organ Transplant Waitlist (`transplant_waitlist.py`)
   - Manages the organ transplant waitlist.

## 10. Cancer Treatment Plans (`cancer_treatment.py`)
   - Tracks stages of cancer treatment.


## Deliverables
Each team should submit:
- The **Python files** containing the solutions for all exercises.
- A **README file** explaining the structure and functionality of your code.
- A **test suite** using `pytest` to validate the correctness of your implementations.
