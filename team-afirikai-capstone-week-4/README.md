# 🏥 Mini Capstone Project – Python for Medical Applications  

## 📌 Overview  
Welcome to the **Mini Capstone Project!** Over the past four weeks, you’ve built a strong foundation in **Python, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), NumPy, and Data Structures**. Now, it's time to **apply your knowledge to solve real-world healthcare challenges!**  

This project will help you develop **medical-focused Python applications** while enhancing your **problem-solving, teamwork, and coding skills**.  

## 🎯 Project Goals  
Your Mini Capstone Project should:  
✅ Apply **Python programming** to a real-world medical problem.  
✅ Use **OOP principles** to design a structured and reusable codebase.  
✅ Leverage **NumPy** for numerical computations in medical data.  
✅ Implement **Data Structures** for efficient data storage and retrieval.  
✅ Encourage **collaboration and collective intelligence** within your team.  

## 💡 Suggested Project Ideas  
Here are some **healthcare-related** project ideas to inspire you:  

### 🔬 Medical Data Processing  
- **Patient Management System:** Design classes for `Patient` and `Doctor` to store and manage medical records.  
- **Medical Data Analysis:** Use NumPy to analyze **patient vitals** (heart rate, blood pressure) and detect anomalies.  

### 🏥 Hospital & Healthcare Systems  
- **Hospital Queue System:** Implement a queue-based system for patient check-in and appointment scheduling.  
- **Medicine Dosage Calculator:** Create an algorithm to calculate personalized medication dosages based on patient data.  

### 🧠 AI & Decision Support  
- **Symptom Checker Chatbot:** Use Python dictionaries and conditional logic to suggest possible medical conditions.  
- **Medical Image Analysis (Basic):** Use NumPy for **image processing** in MRI or X-ray scans.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
To complete this project, you will use:  
🔹 **Python** – Core programming language for development.  
🔹 **NumPy** – Efficient data handling and numerical operations.  
🔹 **OOP Concepts** – For structured and reusable code design.  
🔹 **Data Structures** – Lists, dictionaries, queues, and stacks for medical data management.  
🔹 **Kaggle** – For collaboration and dataset access.  

## 📥 Get Started – Make a Copy of the Sample Notebook  
🔗 **[![Open In Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aondonamoses/mini-capstone-project)**

### 🚀 Steps to Work on the Project  
1. **Make a copy of the sample notebook in Kaggle**  
   - Click on **Copy and Edit** to create a version for your team.  
2. **Collaborate with Your Team**  
   - Assign roles (coding, debugging, testing).  
   - Work together using Kaggle’s shared workspace.  
3. **Add Dataset Link in Your Notebook**  
   - Include the dataset reference in one of the cells like this:  
   ```python
   # 📊 Dataset Used
   dataset_link = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/your-dataset-link"
   print(f"Dataset used: {dataset_link}")
